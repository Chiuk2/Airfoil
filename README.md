# Airfoil
This program displays a 3D wired form of a wing made up of airfoils specific to the user's inputs. The user can adjust the NACA number, number of slices of airfoils, the scale of the airfoils, and the chord length. You can rotate the 3D wing along the x, y, and z axes. This was done with Visual Studio C#.
